A  shitty Python port scanner with banner grabbing 
I maded this tool for the ctf playing because i have seen my nmap tool doesnt work sometime so i cant wait so i maded this tool a shitty 
python port scaner with banner grabbing 
note: if the security is weak then the tool able to grab the service version otherwise not. 
note: you need to put target ip to scan not hostname of the any website like url: www.example.com
